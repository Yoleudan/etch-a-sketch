# etch-a-sketch
The goal of this project is to combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make an etch a sketch drawing program where clicking or hovering the mouse over
squares in a grid will make them change colour allowing you to draw.

1-set up HTML with a div for the grid
    make 16x16 grid with squares inside of the grid
    use loop to make the identical squares
2-use css flexbox to make the squares appear in a grid fashion
3-use JS to make a function that changes the background colour of squares when hovered or clicked
4-make a button that allows people to insert a number between 1-100 for the dimensions of the grid
    ask for input from user with prompt
     if more than 100 produce error message and ask again
     if less than 1 produce error message and ask again
